# Frontend Integration Prompt: Stripe Payment System

## Project Overview
We have implemented a complete Stripe payment system in our Laravel backend API. Your task is to integrate this payment system into the frontend to allow users to purchase ebooks securely through a seamless checkout experience.

## What We've Built (Backend)
- Complete Stripe payment processing system
- Order management with payment tracking
- Secure webhook handling for payment confirmations
- Transaction logging and error handling
- User purchase history integration
- Automatic ebook delivery to user libraries

## Your Mission
Create a complete frontend payment flow that integrates with our existing backend API to process ebook purchases using Stripe payments.

## Required Features

### 1. Checkout Flow
- Integrate with existing shopping cart system
- Collect billing information from users
- Create orders through our API when user selects Stripe payment
- Handle the multi-step payment process (order creation → payment intent → payment processing → confirmation)

### 2. Payment Processing
- Implement Stripe Elements for secure card input
- Handle payment method creation and validation
- Process payments using Stripe's client-side libraries
- Manage payment confirmations with our backend

### 3. User Experience
- Show clear loading states during payment processing
- Display helpful error messages for failed payments
- Provide immediate feedback on successful payments
- Redirect users appropriately after payment completion
- Clear shopping cart after successful purchase

### 4. Error Handling
- Handle network failures gracefully
- Manage Stripe-specific errors (declined cards, expired cards, etc.)
- Show user-friendly error messages
- Provide retry mechanisms for failed payments
- Handle authentication errors

### 5. Security & Validation
- Validate all form inputs before submission
- Never store sensitive payment information
- Use secure communication with backend API
- Implement proper error boundaries

## API Endpoints You'll Work With

### Order Creation
- **Endpoint**: POST /api/v1/checkout
- **Purpose**: Creates an order when payment method is "stripe"
- **Returns**: Order details with pending payment status

### Payment Intent Creation  
- **Endpoint**: POST /api/v1/stripe/payment-intent
- **Purpose**: Creates Stripe payment intent for an order
- **Returns**: Client secret for frontend payment processing

### Payment Confirmation
- **Endpoint**: POST /api/v1/stripe/confirm-payment  
- **Purpose**: Confirms payment completion on backend
- **Returns**: Final order and transaction details

### Payment Status Check
- **Endpoint**: GET /api/v1/stripe/payment-status/{id}
- **Purpose**: Check current payment status
- **Returns**: Payment and order status information

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies
- Install Stripe JavaScript SDK (@stripe/stripe-js)
- Use environment variables for Stripe publishable key
- Integrate with existing authentication system

### Payment Flow Steps
1. User initiates checkout from cart
2. Collect billing information through form
3. Create order via backend API  
4. Create payment intent via backend API
5. Process payment using Stripe Elements
6. Confirm payment completion with backend
7. Handle success/failure scenarios
8. Update UI and redirect user appropriately

### Form Requirements
- Billing information collection (name, email, address, etc.)
- Secure card input using Stripe Elements
- Form validation and error display
- Loading states during processing
- Mobile-responsive design

### Integration Points
- Shopping cart system (clear cart after successful payment)
- User authentication (use existing auth tokens)
- Order history (redirect to orders page after success)
- User library (ebooks automatically added after payment)

## Testing Requirements

### Test Scenarios
- Successful payment flow end-to-end
- Various card decline scenarios
- Network failure handling
- Invalid form data submission
- Authentication token expiration
- Mobile device compatibility

### Test Cards
- Use Stripe's test card numbers for development
- Test successful payments, declined cards, and various error scenarios
- Verify proper error message display

## UI/UX Expectations

### Design Requirements
- Clean, professional checkout interface
- Clear step indicators for multi-step process
- Prominent security indicators (SSL, secure payment badges)
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Accessibility compliance

### User Feedback
- Real-time form validation
- Clear error messages with actionable advice
- Loading indicators during processing
- Success confirmation with order details
- Email confirmation integration

## Deliverables Expected

### Core Implementation
- Complete checkout flow with Stripe integration
- Responsive payment forms with validation
- Error handling for all scenarios
- Success and failure page flows
- Integration with existing cart and auth systems

### Quality Assurance
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Mobile device testing
- Payment flow testing with various scenarios
- Performance optimization
- Security review of implementation

### Documentation
- Setup instructions for development environment
- Testing procedures and test scenarios
- Deployment considerations
- Troubleshooting guide

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- Users can successfully purchase ebooks using credit/debit cards
- Payment failures are handled gracefully with clear messaging

1. Which frontend framework/library are you using?
2. Do you have existing design mockups or should you create the UI design?
3. Are there specific accessibility requirements to follow?
4. Should the implementation support multiple currencies?
5. Do you need offline payment handling or retry mechanisms?
6. Are there specific browser support requirements?
7. Should you implement saved payment methods for returning customers?
